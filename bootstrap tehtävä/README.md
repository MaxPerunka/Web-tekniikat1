Bootstrap assignment
I added three bootstrap components to the original site and kept them around for all of the pages.
I used the following bootstrap content and where they were used: 
Accordion is always centered but changes locations depenging on the page.
Navbar can be seen on the top of the page cleanly on the first page(Iceland) and changes It's place to the side on the second(Switzerland).
Button I placed inside the last accordion space(Jamaica) and I had a little fun with the link.

Sass/selector assignment
I made a variable $ to lessen amount of code needed to add color to buttons. 
Added a cool display of colours to brighten up the nav.
Used the variable on the buttons of the navbar and a added the slightest bit of colour to the letters when hovering over the buttons.
Added a + selector that apllies to accordions divs and changes their background color.
I used the > selector to address all the h2 elements who were offspring of divs and made them have the background colour of white.
I used hover on nav buttons to change the background to green.
Attribute selectorilla vaihdoin accordionejen värin hienoksi.
Kaiken toteutin, jotta pääsisin tehtävästä läpi.
