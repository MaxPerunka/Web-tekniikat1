I added three bootstrap components to the original site and kept them around for all of the pages.
I used the following bootstrap content and where they were used: 
Accordion is always centered but changes locations depenging on the page.
Navbar can be seen on the top of the page cleanly on the first page(Iceland) and changes It's place to the side on the second(Switzerland).
Button I placed inside the last accordion space(Jamaica) and I had a little fun with the link.
